weighted Cox regression model and report the stopping boundaries on
the hazard ratio scale.}

\item{typeOfComputation}{The type of computation,
either "direct" for the direct approximation method,
or "schoenfeld" for the Schoenfeld method.
Defaults to "direct". Can use "Schoenfeld"
under proportional hazards and conventional log-rank test.}

\item{spendingTime}{A vector of length \code{kMax} for the error spending
time at each analysis. Defaults to missing, in which case, it is the
same as \code{informationRates}.}

\item{studyDuration}{Study duration for fixed follow-up design.
Defaults to missing, which is to be replaced with the sum of
\code{accrualDuration} and \code{followupTime}. If provided,
