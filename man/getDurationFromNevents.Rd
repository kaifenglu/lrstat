}
\arguments{
\item{nevents}{The target number of events.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{Allocation ratio for the active treatment
versus control. Defaults to 1 for equal randomization.}

\item{accrualTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise Poisson enrollment time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 3)} breaks the time axis into 2 accrual intervals:
[0, 3) and [3, Inf).}

\item{accrualIntensity}{A vector of accrual intensities. One for
each accrual time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{stratumFraction}{A vector of stratum fractions that sum to 1.
Defaults to 1 for no stratification.}

\item{lambda1}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{lambda2}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the control group.}

\item{gamma1}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{gamma2}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the control group.}

\item{followupTime}{Follow-up time for the last enrolled subjects.
Must be provided for fixed follow-up design.}

\item{fixedFollowup}{Whether a fixed follow-up design is used.
Defaults to 0 for variable follow-up.}

\item{npoints}{The number of accrual duration time points.
Defaults to 23.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{nevents}: The target number of events.
\item \code{fixedFollowup}: Whether a fixed follow-up design is used.
\item \code{accrualDuration}: The accrual duration.
\item \code{subjects}: The total number of subjects.
\item \code{followupTime}: The follow-up time for the last enrolled subject.
\item \code{studyDuration}: The study duration.
}
}
\description{
Obtains a range of accrual duration to reach the
target number of events.
