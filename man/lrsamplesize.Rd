log-rank test. Defaults to 0 for conventional log-rank test.}

\item{numSubintervals}{Number of sub-intervals to approximate the mean
and variance of the weighted log-rank test score statistic.

weighted Cox regression model and report the stopping boundaries on 
the hazard ratio scale.}

\item{interval}{The interval to search for the solution of
accrualDuration or followupDuration. Defaults to \code{c(0.001, 240)}.
Adjustment may be needed for non-monotone relationship with study power.}
