\title{Integrated event probability over an interval}
\usage{
pd(
  t1 = NA_real_,
  t2 = NA_real_,
  piecewiseSurvivalTime = 0L,
  lambda = NA_real_,
  gamma = 0L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t1}{Lower bound of the analysis time interval.}

\item{t2}{Upper bound of the analysis time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{lambda}{A vector of hazard rates for the event. One for
each analysis time interval.}

\item{gamma}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout or a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout. Defaults to 0 for no dropout.}
}
\value{
A value for the integrated probability of having an event
during an interval for a treatment group with specified
piecewise exponential survival and dropout distributions.
}
\description{
Obtains the integration of the probability of having an event
during an interval. The specified analysis time interval can span more
than one analysis time interval with constant hazard.
}
\examples{
# Piecewise exponential survival with hazard 0.0533 in the first 6 months,
# and hazard 0.0309 thereafter, and 5\% dropout by the end of 1 year.

pd(t1 = 1, t2 = 8, piecewiseSurvivalTime = c(0, 6),
   lambda = c(0.0533, 0.0309), gamma = -log(1-0.05)/12)
