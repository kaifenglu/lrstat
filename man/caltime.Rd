  nevents = NA_real_,
  allocationRatioPlanned = 1,
  accrualTime = 0L,
  accrualIntensity = NA_real_,
  piecewiseSurvivalTime = 0L,
  stratumFraction = 1L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nevents}{A vector of target number of events.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{Allocation ratio for the active treatment
versus control. Defaults to 1 for equal randomization.}

\item{accrualTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise Poisson enrollment time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 3)} breaks the time axis into 2 accrual intervals:
[0, 3) and [3, Inf).}

\item{accrualIntensity}{A vector of accrual intensities. One for
each accrual time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{stratumFraction}{A vector of stratum fractions that sum to 1.
Defaults to 1 for no stratification.}

\item{lambda1}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{lambda2}{A vector of hazard rates for the event in each analysis
time interval by stratum for the control group.}

\item{gamma1}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the active treatment group.}

\item{gamma2}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout, a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout applicable for all strata, or a
vector of hazard rates for dropout in each analysis time interval
by stratum for the control group.}

\item{accrualDuration}{Duration of the enrollment period.}

\item{followupTime}{Follow-up time for the last enrolled subject.}

\item{fixedFollowup}{Whether a fixed follow-up design is used.
Defaults to 0 for variable follow-up.}
}
\value{
A vector of calendar times expected to yield the target
number of events.
}
\description{
Obtains the calendar times needed to reach the target
number of subjects experiencing an event.
