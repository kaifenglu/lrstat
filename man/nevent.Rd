  time = NA_real_,
  allocationRatioPlanned = 1,
  accrualTime = 0L,
  accrualIntensity = NA_real_,
  piecewiseSurvivalTime = 0L,
  lambda1 = NA_real_,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{A vector of analysis times at which to calculate the number
of patients having an event.}

\item{allocationRatioPlanned}{Allocation ratio for the active treatment
versus control. Defaults to 1 for equal randomization.}

\item{accrualTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise Poisson enrollment time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 3)} breaks the time axis into 2 accrual intervals:
[0, 3) and [3, Inf).}

\item{accrualIntensity}{A vector of accrual intensities. One for
each accrual time interval.}

\item{piecewiseSurvivalTime}{A vector that specifies the starting time of
piecewise exponential survival time intervals. Must start with 0, e.g.,
\code{c(0, 6)} breaks the time axis into 2 event intervals:
[0, 6) and [6, Inf).
Defaults to 0 for exponential distribution.}

\item{lambda1}{A vector of hazard rates for the event for the
active treatment group. One for each analysis time interval.}

\item{lambda2}{A vector of hazard rates for the event for the
control group. One for each analysis time interval.}

\item{gamma1}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout or a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout for the active treatment group.
Defaults to 0 for no dropout.}

\item{gamma2}{The hazard rate for exponential dropout or a vector of hazard
rates for piecewise exponential dropout for the control group.
Defaults to 0 for no dropout.}

\item{accrualDuration}{Duration of the enrollment period.}

\item{minFollowupTime}{Follow-up time for the last enrolled subject.}

\item{maxFollowupTime}{Follow-up time for the first enrolled subject.
For fixed followup, \code{maxFollowupTime = minFollowupTime}.
For variable followup,
\code{maxFollowupTime = accrualDuration + minFollowupTime}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of the number of patients having an event at the specified
analysis times (row) for each treatment group (column).
}
\description{
Obtains the number of subjects having an event by given
analysis times for each treatment group.
