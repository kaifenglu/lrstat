Description: Performs power and sample size calculation for non-proportional 
  hazards model using the Fleming-Harrington family of weighted log-rank 
  tests. The sequentially calculated log-rank test score statistics are 
  assumed to have independent increments as characterized in 
  Anastasios A. Tsiatis (1982) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1982.10477898>. The mean 
  and variance of log-rank test score statistics are calculated based on 
  Kaifeng Lu (2021) <doi:10.1002/pst.2069>. The boundary crossing probabilities 
  are calculated using the recursive integration algorithm described in 
  Christopher Jennison and Bruce W. Turnbull (2000, ISBN:0849303168).
