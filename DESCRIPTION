Description: Performs power and sample size calculation for non-proportional 
  hazards model using the Fleming-Harrington family of weighted log-rank 
  tests. The sequentially calculated log-rank test score statistics are 
  assumed to have independent increments as characterized in 
  Anastasios A. Tsiatis (1982) <doi:10.1080/01621459.1982.10477898>. The mean 
  and variance of log-rank test score statistics are calculated based on 
  Kaifeng Lu (2021) <doi:10.1002/pst.2069>. The boundary crossing probabilities 
  are calculated using the recursive integration algorithm described in 
  Christopher Jennison and Bruce W. Turnbull (2000, ISBN:0849303168). 
  The package can also be used for continuous, binary, and count data. 
  For continuous data, it can handle missing data through mixed-model
  for repeated measures (MMRM). In crossover designs, it can estimate
  direct treatment effects while accounting for carryover effects.
  For binary data, it can design Simon's 2-stage, modified toxicity 
  probability-2 (mTPI-2), and Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) trials. 
  For count data, it can design group 
  sequential trials for negative binomial endpoints with censoring. 
  Additionally, it facilitates group sequential equivalence trials for 
  all supported data types. Moreover, it can design adaptive group 
  sequential trials for changes in sample size, error spending function, 
  number and spacing or future looks. Finally, it offers various options for 
  adjusted p-values, including graphical and gatekeeping procedures.
