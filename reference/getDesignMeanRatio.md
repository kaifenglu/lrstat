```

## Arguments

- beta:

  The type II error.

- n:

  The total sample size.

- meanRatioH0:

  The mean ratio under the null hypothesis. Defaults to 1.

- meanRatio:

  The mean ratio under the alternative hypothesis.

- CV:

  The coefficient of variation. The standard deviation on the log scale
  is equal to `sqrt(log(1 + CV^2))`.

- allocationRatioPlanned:

  Allocation ratio for the active treatment versus control. Defaults to
  1 for equal randomization.

- normalApproximation:

  The type of computation of the p-values. If `TRUE`, the variance is
  assumed to be known, otherwise the calculations are performed with the
  t distribution. The exact calculation using the t distribution is only
  implemented for the fixed design.

- rounding:

  Whether to round up sample size. Defaults to 1 for sample size
  rounding.

- kMax:

  The maximum number of stages.

- informationRates:

  The information rates. Fixed prior to the trial. Defaults to
  `(1:kMax) / kMax` if left unspecified.

- efficacyStopping:

  Indicators of whether efficacy stopping is allowed at each stage.
  Defaults to `TRUE` if left unspecified.

- futilityStopping:

  Indicators of whether futility stopping is allowed at each stage.
  Defaults to `TRUE` if left unspecified.

- criticalValues:

  Upper boundaries on the z-test statistic scale for stopping for
  efficacy.

- alpha:

  The significance level. Defaults to 0.025.

- typeAlphaSpending:

  The type of alpha spending. One of the following: `"OF"` for
  O'Brien-Fleming boundaries, `"P"` for Pocock boundaries, `"WT"` for
  Wang & Tsiatis boundaries, `"sfOF"` for O'Brien-Fleming type spending
  function, `"sfP"` for Pocock type spending function, `"sfKD"` for Kim
  & DeMets spending function, `"sfHSD"` for Hwang, Shi & DeCani spending
  function, `"user"` for user defined spending, and `"none"` for no
  early efficacy stopping. Defaults to `"sfOF"`.

- parameterAlphaSpending:

  The parameter value for the alpha spending. Corresponds to \\\Delta\\
  for `"WT"`, \\\rho\\ for `"sfKD"`, and \\\gamma\\ for `"sfHSD"`.

- userAlphaSpending:

  The user defined alpha spending. Cumulative alpha spent up to each
  stage.

- futilityBounds:

  Lower boundaries on the z-test statistic scale for stopping for
  futility at stages `1, ..., kMax-1`. Defaults to `rep(-8, kMax-1)` if
  left unspecified. The futility bounds are non-binding for the
  calculation of critical values.

- futilityCP:

  The futility boundary on the conditional power scale.

- futilityMeanRatio:

  The futility boundary on the mean ratio scale.

- typeBetaSpending:

  The type of beta spending. One of the following: `"sfOF"` for
  O'Brien-Fleming type spending function, `"sfP"` for Pocock type
  spending function, `"sfKD"` for Kim & DeMets spending function,
  `"sfHSD"` for Hwang, Shi & DeCani spending function, `"user"` for user
  defined spending, and `"none"` for no early futility stopping.
  Defaults to `"none"`.

- parameterBetaSpending:

  The parameter value for the beta spending. Corresponds to \\\rho\\ for
  `"sfKD"`, and \\\gamma\\ for `"sfHSD"`.

- userBetaSpending:

  The user defined beta spending. Cumulative beta spent up to each
  stage.

- spendingTime:

  A vector of length `kMax` for the error spending time at each
  analysis. Defaults to missing, in which case, it is the same as
  `informationRates`.
